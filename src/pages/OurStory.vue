            <p>A benevolent philanthropist and a devoted country man, Rai Bahadur Gujarmal Modi was a visionary who started his journey as an apprentice for his father's business in 1919, but his entrepreneurial spirit and fervor to do good for people led him to Delhi with just Rs. 400 in his pocket from which he built an empire.</p>

This marked the beginning of an exciting entrepreneurial journey for him. Rai Bahadur Gujar Mal Modi was far ahead of his time and believed that strong people build a stronger country. Dwelling on this thought, he made sure that every worker of the sugar mill was allotted a house which was a first then and even today. He changed the entire landscape of Modinagar by making the town self-sufficient with modern housing, schools, and college amenities.</p>

                                <p>The story of quiet resilience and development of this once laidback town is a testimony to the determination of Rai Bahadur Gujarmal Modi. He was also awarded with the prestigious Padma Bhushan in 1968 for his valuable contribution to the development of the society.</p>

                                <p>Rai Bahadur Gujarmal Modi continued to build his empire that saw his business expand into various sectors and grow into a multibillion-dollar global conglomerate. He did it by setting up of a soap factory, oil crushing plant, paint and varnish factory, glycerin extraction plant, cotton textile mill, lantern factory, steel mill and yarn mill among many others which rose to prominence during the period from 1940 - 1963.</p>

                                <p>Modicare has continued its ascent into becoming one of the most well respected and revered companies in India by carrying on the dedicated quest of following the values laid by our great founder.
